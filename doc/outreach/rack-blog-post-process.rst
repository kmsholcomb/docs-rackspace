This guide describes both how to write a blog post for the Rackspace blog
(writing tips and content suggestions) and how to contribute the post for
publication.

Blog writing and submission process
-----------------------------------

#. Email the blog team at blog@rackspace.com with the following information:

   a. Topic of the blog, its goal, and audience
   b. When you expect to deliver the content
   c. When you want it to be published. (Allow at least 3-5 days of lead time
      between delivering the content and publication, but Creative prefers more
      lead-time (+2 weeks) for more in-depth posts and announcements. We may
      need more time to work with the Creative department or engage other teams
      for complex topics or blogs needing graphics.)

#. What is the significance of the content of the post? (Is it a new offering?
   How is it helpful to existing or potential customers? Does it frame our
   expertise is a new way? Does it describe a new corporate strategy or
   initiative?)

#. Explain how the content of the post aligns to, supports, or strengthens
   Rackspace’s current business priorities and strategy.

#. Who is the target audience for this post?

#. What specific customer problems or pain points does the post address?
   Provide names of customers willing to be references in support of the post.

#. Does the post describe something that Rackspace does better than the
   competition or that no other competitor offers? Does the post provide
   quantifiable and defensible information (such as performance metrics)
   showing the Rackspace edge over the competition? If yes, explain.

#. Will this news announcement help Rackspace to gain market share or mind
   share, or to grow revenue? If so, in what way?

Blog topic suggestions (documentation-related)
----------------------------------------------

*  Blog post about the upstream work you are currently doing (with OpenStack
   or potentially another open source project).

*  Blog about the writing groups that you attend.

*  Blog about information architecture and how we’re making it work for
   Rackspace documentation.

*  Blog about assessing the quality of good documentation and how we manage
   it for Rackspace.

*  Blog about the docs-as-code process we have – especially now we have a
   tutorial up in MyLearn!

*  Post a blog review of any technical documentation books or sites
   (for example, Every Page is Page One).

*  Blog about why we can’t just remove docs in favor of just reading the
   source code.

Blog writing suggestions
------------------------

Before you start writing, consider the following questions:

*  What is the goal of this post?

*  Is it to announce a new product or feature?

*  Is it to be helpful and answer a question/offer a How To?

*  Is it to provide “thought leadership” or show our expertise in an area?

*  Is it to drive traffic to a landing page, or drum up attendance to a
   webinar?

*  Is it something else altogether? If so, what?

  It’s possible that your idea might be better presented as an article in the
  How-To or as a technical or marketing white paper.

  When you write your content, we recommend the following rules of thumb:

  *  **Length**: Rackspace blog posts generally run between 500-1,000 words,
     but let the content be your guide. Take the space you need to tell your
     story, but don’t pad it unnecessarily. Going long is okay, too, as long
     as it’s worth reading.

  *  **Tools**: We recommend using a word processor, like MicroSoft Word, or a
     text editor for your writing.

  *  **General Format**: Send your blog contact (that’s Tracy or Abe - see
      contact information at the bottom of these instructions) your draft as
      a Word document. They will edit it with tracked changes and send back
      for your approval.

     -  an attention-grabbing opening, known in the news biz as a “lede”

     - a “nut graf” - a sentence or two letting readers know what you’re going
       to be talking about and why it matters

     -  some background information or context, such as the history of a
        product

     - a conclusion (and a call to action, if appropriate) with links and
       contact information.

Blogging tips
-------------

Following are some good blogging tips:

*  **Write a good “lede”**.
   When crafting your lede, consider how the information
   in your post helps customers. An announcement of a new product is not a
   lede, but that product’s money-saving capacity may well be one!

   For example:

   **Not good**: “Today Rackspace is pleased to announce the release of four
   new features in Office 365.”

   **Good**: “Increased storage, security and cost-saving measures are now
   available to enhance the already-robust Office 365 suite available from
   Rackspace, making it even more attractive to a wider variety of business
   users.”

*  **Stay focused on your topic**.
   If you find yourself straying, you may have enough material for a series.
   It’s okay to break up a big topic into more digestible bites.

*  **Formulas like How to, Top 5 or 10, and curated lists tend to do well**.
   This HubSpot blog topic generator
   (https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator) might help you with ideas.
   Another tool, Portent (https://www.portent.com/tools/title-maker), creates
   post titles/topics from keywords.

*  **Think “be helpful”** rather than trying to selling a product or service.
   WHAT does the product do? HOW does it help the customer?

*  **Use concrete examples** whenever possible.

*  **Bullet points** are useful for listing features

*  **Show don’t tell**. Can you create a graphic or image, or add a screen shot
   to illustrate your point?

*  **Avoid jargon!** Rackers (and the entire tech industry) tend to speak in
   jargon. Unless your post is aimed at a technical audience, use plain
   English. There is never a reason to use business jargon.

*  **Link link link**. First product mention? Link to the product page. Outside
   accolades? Link to it. Citing a study or source or article? Link to it.
   Have we written about it before? Link to it. Mention a partner or customer?
   Link to their site.

*  **Keep it concise**. The internet has shrunken everyone’s attention span.
   Say it once, say it well. No need to repeat the same information in
   different format. Similarly, keep paragraphs short. Long blocks of text are
   intimidating.

*  **Always include a call to action (CTA)**. Give readers the nest step to
   take: go to a landing page, sign up for a webinar, click to
   Rackspace.com/_______, etc.

*  **If you get stuck, don’t fret**. Just send your draft to the blog team
   (contact information at the end of this document). They will help you.
